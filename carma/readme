 Game Exercise
===========================
A playing area is 100m x 100m. A game has a referee and 10 players. 
A player moves 1m every second and starts out in a random place on the playing area. 
A referee has to give a yellow card to a player if that player moves within 
2m of another player. 

It is the player that moves to within 2m gets the card. 

If a player gets 2 yellow cards, the player is ejected from the game for 10 seconds.
 
When a player is off 10 secs the player needs to ask the referee if they are eligible to play again. 

The referee will let the player return to playing the first time this happens, 

but not subsequent times. The last player left playing is the winner.
 
Write a console application that emulates this activity. 


The included version of the app has these tunable settings
final static int MaxPlayers = 10;		// spec. says 10 - 2 is better for dev
final static int XFieldPos = 100;		// spec. says 100, 20 is better for dev
final static int YFieldPos = 100;		// spec. says 100, 20 is better for dev
final static int RunInterval = 1000;	// 10 - 10000 seconds. 1000 is better for dev 

During the creation of the app I played around with the above variables
and determined that 10 seconds is a bit long to recalculate and process
the players. 

I have left System.out.println statements for pertinent output. 

The program was written and tested in Eclipse Neon.2
The jdk used is: jdk1.8.0_151
Adjust accordingly.
